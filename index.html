	<p>Welcome to my website! My name is Matthew (Matt) T. Cota and I am a PhD Student in Political Science at Michigan State University. I earned my B.A. in Political Science from the University of Minnesota â€“ Twin Cities in 2022, <i>Phi Beta Kappa</i>.</p>
  
	<p>My research interests are in American political institutions with a focus on the federal judiciary, particuarly the U.S. Supreme Court. My work is centered on explaining the behavior of the Supreme Court and its justices. I employ quantatitive methods to examine and identify the factors that shape judicial decision making and the inner workings of the judicial process.<p>
	
	<p>My teaching is focused on the judiciary and the law, and quantitive research methods. I have taught courses on constitutional law and taught labs for introductory quantitative methods courses. In addition to teaching, I enjoy working with undergraduate students on research projects.</p>

	<p>Outside of political science, I love spending time with family, running, brewing coffee, reading history and short stories, hiking and camping, cooking, and playing guitar. I was born and raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota and am an avid fan of the Vikings, Twins, and Gophers (when they are doing well, at least).</p>
